NAME
       winfo - download and display weather information from wunderground

SYNOPSIS
       winfo [-h] [-v] [-f] [profile]

DESCRIPTION
       winfo  is  a  simple  command-line  program for downloading and displaying
       weather information from wunderground. It stores the  downloaded  data  on
       disk in order to allow fast access, and can be used to update the informa‐
       tion at regular intervals using a job scheduler. All  data  is  stored  in
       JSON format, so it can easily be used by other programs. Information about
       what data to download and display is controlled by profiles in the  user's
       home directory.

ARGUMENTS
       -h     Print usage information about the program, then exit.

       -v     Print version information about the program and exit.

       -f     Download new weather data instead of printing cached data.

       profile
              Use  the  given  profile  to  configure what weather information to
              download. The profiles are stored in ~/.config/winfo/  by  default.
              If  no  profile  is  specified,  'default' is used. See the section
              below for more information.

PROFILES
       The behavior of this program is controlled by the use of  profiles.  These
       profiles  are stored in ~/.config/winfo/ by default. Each profile contains
       information in the JSON format. Each profile must include the set of  fea‐
       tures for downloading, the query location to download for, a valid wunder‐
       ground developer's key, and an output format. If no profile is given, then
       the  ~/.config/winfo/default.json  profile is used. Otherwise, the profile
       ~/.config/winfo/<profile>.json is used. See the included documentation for
       more details on profiles.

BUGS
       Probably. This hasn't been tested extensively. Report any bugs you find to
       the github page http://github.com/velentr/winfo.git
